  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the DSM driver using PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs

  @Description
    This source file provides APIs for DSM.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  PIC10 / PIC12 / PIC16 / PIC18 MCUs - 1.81.6
        Device            :  PIC18F47Q10
        Driver Version    :  2.01
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 2.30 and above 
        MPLAB 	          :  MPLAB X 5.40
